### Hi there üëã I am a recent graduate of the mighty Makers Academy software development bootcamp but my background is working in the TV and Radio industry as a comedy writer and programme development producer.

I have written gags for many high-profile TV series, sketches for big name performers and have created original TV programmes, radio shows and podcasts. Wanting a new challenge, I am now applying my creative thinking, problem-solving and obsession with syntax to software development.

I've put 'Full Stack Software Developer' rather grandly at the top there ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and, sure, I have learned a huge amount during 16 weeks of bootcamp but I can't pretend to be a seasoned engineer. I can say though, without any hesitation, that I love coding, learning new skills and working in teams of smart people building machines out of words.
