## üîé **About me**

This might be the only CV you read from a dev who's written script for React, MongoDB and Graham Norton. I am a recent graduate of the mighty Makers Academy software development bootcamp but my background is working in the TV and Radio industry as a comedy writer and programme development producer.

I have written gags for many high-profile TV series, sketches for big name performers and have created original TV programmes, radio shows and podcasts. Wanting a new challenge, I am now applying my creative thinking, problem-solving and obsession with syntax to software development.

 I've put 'Full Stack Software Developer' rather grandly at the top there ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and, sure, I have learned a **huge** amount during 16 weeks of bootcamp but I can't pretend to be a seasoned engineer. I can say though, without any hesitation, that I love coding, learning new skills and working in teams of smart people building machines out of words. 

## üíª **Projects**
| Project | Description | Technologies |

| [**Bank Tech Test**](https://github.com/sirdavy/bank-tech-test) | This was a practice tech test during Week 10 of the Makers course where we had to create a virtual bank. <br> A key focus during this project was to work on my planning and documentation of the project. | Ruby |
| [**Gilded Rose Tech Test**](https://github.com/sirdavy/gilded-rose-tech-test-ruby) | This is my attempt at the Gilded Rose kata set by Makers Academy; a tech test commonly used to test a dev's ability to read, refactor and extend legacy code. The specifications are here.| Ruby |

## ‚ú® Skills
* **Creative Thinker** - *That's half an hour of my life I'll never get back.* It's a well-worn phrase, and it went through my head right after being cut off while on hold to the bank. But it made me think; what if you could get a temporal refund on all the time-sucks in your life? Jump to a year later, and it is now the premise of a podcast I've created for Audible. Between that first thought and the recording, however, there has been a lot of creative heavy-lifting - fleshing out the format, writing up and designing a pitch deck, making changes after feedback. Keeping you mind open to ideas is one thing but getting down to the nitty-gritty creative work of writing and rewriting is something I'm very comfortable with. 

* **Communicator** - I write scripts and devise television show formats for a living but I also have to sell, or pitch, these ideas face-to-face with producers and commissioners. With this experience I feel confident in saying that not only do I have good written and verbal skills I also know how to read the room and articulate often complex ideas in a persuasive manner. 

* **Teamwork** - There's a famous tenet in improv comedy, that when a performer begins building a premise on stage their fellow performers should react with a 'yes, and' response - 'yes' meaning 'I'm going to run with this' and the 'and' adds to that idea. Whenever I've worked on a show in a writers' room or with a development team from another production company it can be a bit of a creative scrum, lots of thoughts get pitched in and often there'll be ideas which seem to conflict logically with the project. It's in these situations I've always tried to adopt a 'yes, and' mindset. It doesn't mean, at the end of a session, each idea is equal in strength, but you don't know how strong an idea might be until you've given it some 'yes, and' as a group.

* **Attention To Detail** - Part of working as a writer is problem solving, being able to look at an idea analytically and figure out why it‚Äôs not working or how it can be improved. I have written scripts, rewritten them and rewritten them, that is the process - constant improvement. It builds a habit of meticulousness and attention to detail; a word in the wrong place and a joke loses its punch, a typo in some dialogue and a scene doesn‚Äôt make sense.
  
* **Working To A Brief** - It's often the case I'll turn up in the morning to work on a new show, be given a brief by the producer and be expected to hand over many pages of material by the end of the day. It's high-pressure stuff. Briefs for shows, however, can range from very detailed outlines to vague, hand-wavy thoughts, and for each case, in order to deliver work that's on target, I am very experienced at asking the right questions, taking the temperature, and getting a feel for what a client really wants.
